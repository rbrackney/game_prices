<h2> WELCOME TO STEAM SALE FORECASTER PROJECT REPO</h2>

Steamsaleforecaster.info was a project created in 3 weeks for the Insight Data Science project. 

In this repo, you'll find the code I conducted to model steam sale occurences. It is broken up into two parts: data collection, and data analysis. If you're looking for the code used to run the steamsaleforecaster.info, you can find it in my other repo, <i>steamsaleforcaster</i>.
